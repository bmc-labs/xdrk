## 1.0.0 - end of November 2020
This was basically the first version worth mentioning, and it was as stable as
the underlying library allowed. That is, it carried all functionality of the
raw bindings for the C based library into a robust Rust interface which hid all
the `unsafe` ugliness from the user. The API, however, was still as basic as
the original library provided by AiM.
