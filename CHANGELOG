# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- implement interface to GPS, now same as other channels
- calculation of lap distance from GPS

### Changed
- type `RunData` has been renamed to `Run`
- simplified API for `XdrkFile`
- slight improvements and simplifications on API of `Channel` and `RawChannel`
- the `frequency` methods now return f64 for BSON serializability
- moved `Channel` and all functionality to optimus, `xdrk` now only provides
    raw channels via the API
- the `Raw` prefix has thus been dropped (except for AiM's GPS stuff)
- moved distance calculation from `Lap` to optimus, as planned
- `Run` is created by calling `Run::from_file` now, as opposed to before:
    `Run::new`, which by convention tends to return a virgin object

### Fixed
- data vectors in `RawChannelData` previously weren't zeroed; now they are

## [1.2.0] - 2020-12-15
### Added
- loads of API for easier access to data
- implementation of converting to a more usable format
- synchronization of channels
- along with synchronization: space savings by going from f64 to f32

## 1.0.0 - end of November 2020
This was basically the first version worth mentioning, and it was as stable as
the underlying library allowed. That is, it carried all functionality of the
raw bindings for the C based library into a robust Rust interface which hid all
the `unsafe` ugliness from the user. The API, however, was still as basic as
the original library provided by AiM.
