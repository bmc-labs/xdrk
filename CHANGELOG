## 1.0.0 - end of September 2021
First actual release, and a reasonable starting point for CHANGELOG keeping. It
has been decided to make it a major release, since at this point it has been
tested internally somewhat and although there are still some doubts regarding
thread safety and the benefit of doing so much of the initial work when opening
the file for caching, it seems to be working sufficiently well to be used in
production for us. YMMV, issue reports are welcome.

## 0.1.0 - end of November 2020
This was basically the first version worth mentioning, and it was as stable as
the underlying library allowed. That is, it carried all functionality of the
raw bindings for the C based library into a robust Rust interface which hid all
the `unsafe` ugliness from the user. The API, however, was still as basic as
the original library provided by AiM.
